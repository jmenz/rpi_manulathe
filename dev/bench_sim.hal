# 1. Load the PyVCP Panel
loadusr -Wn bench_test pyvcp -c bench_test dev/bench_test.xml

# 2. Connect "Virtual Joystick" to your Mixer Component
# The Scale in PyVCP creates a float pin with suffix "-f"
net joy-sim-input  bench_test.joystick-val-f  => mix.x.joy-in
net joy-sim-input  => mix.z.joy-in

# 3. Connect "Virtual Spindle" (Handwheel) directly to feedback
# This tricks LinuxCNC and your component into thinking the spindle is turning
# net spindle-pos    bench_test.hand-turn-f     => spindle.0.revs
# net spindle-pos    => mix.x.spindle-revs
# net spindle-pos    => mix.z.spindle-revs
